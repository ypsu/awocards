<h2 id=rules>Rules <a href=#rules>¶</a></h2>
<p>
  awocards (formed from "AWkward Option CARDS") is a simple turn based game for 2-6 players with a set of question, dare, vote cards with personal and sexual content.
</p>

<p>
  Distribute 4 voting chips to each player.
  Each voting chip is a piece of paper with a 1-4 digit on one side.
  Shuffle the printed version of the cards and put them into a stack in the middle of the desk.
  Each round someone pulls the card from the top.
  Each type of card plays differently:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Question card (cards that have a question and 2-4 answers): the card puller has to answer the question.
    If none of the answers feel true, then in that case just pick the "closest" or "the least wrong" answer from the list.
    Once they figured out the answer, they put the answer's voting chip face down in front of them.
    The guessers have to guess what the answerer answer is.
    They also put a voting chip face down in front of them.
    Reveal everyone's vote chip once everyone has a voting chip in front of them.
    Players who have guessed wrong have to explain why they picked their answer.
  <li>
    Vote card (cards that start with "Group vote"): each player votes how much interest they have doing the activity together with all the other members of the group.
    Reveal the voting chips once everyone finished voting.
    If nobody answered "definitely not" then make a plan doing that activity later on.
  <li>
    Dare card (cards that start with "Dare"): the card puller needs to decide if they would be willing to receive said act from anyone from the group.
    If no then see if there's anybody else in the group to volunteer their body for the act.
    If there's no volunteer then just go to the next round.
    If there's a volunteer then the rest of the group uses the voting chip to express how much interest they have giving said act to the volunteer's body.
    Reveal the voting chips once everyone answered.
    The receiver can choose someone who didn't answer "definitely not" to do the activity to them for at most 1 minute.
    Others, umm, just watch.
</ul>

<p>
  The rules are not set in stone.
  Alter them to whatever that makes sense for your group.
  Playing as a couple?
  Drop the voting chips and reveal the answer simultaneously via hands by showing your answer's number via your hands (assuming you have at least 4 healthy fingers).
  If a question, answer, or an activity is unclear then change it to something that makes sense.
  Or just draw a different card.
  Your game, your rules.
</p>

<p>
  Be aware that some cards can be quite spicy.
  Play this game with your most trusted polyamorous LGBTQ-friendly friends only.
  It can feel magical when people fully open up to each other.
</p>

<p>
  Play only the "softball" question and "activites" vote cards if you are unsure or have a rather conservative group.
  The game won't be that deep and interesting but it could be still a bit fun.
</p>

<p>
  The game is stateless, there's no score to track or anything.
  Think of it as a conversation starter.
  The best outcome is that the game is abandoned because you found an interesting topic to chat about.
  Play it for 30 minutes and switch to some other game if people don't enjoy it.
</p>

<h2 id=phonegame>Playing with phones <a href=#phonegame>¶</a></h2>

<p>
  Use printed cards + real voting chips for the best experience.
  People shouldn't be poking at their phones in such a social game.
  Don't play this online, it's too awkward for that.
<p>

<p>
  If you have voting chips (e.g. from Dixit) then just present the current card from a phone or two but play with the voting chips.
  If you don't have chips handy then this site provides a networked version that can be played with phones.
  The host should start the game via the "Start game" option and then in the in-game settings tick the "host game" option.
  Then they should share the join code with others.
</p>

<p>
  Each player should follow the instructions at the top section above the question.
  Tap around, do a few test rounds, hopefully the interface makes sense after a few rounds.
</p>

<p>
  It's also possible to spectate the game, e.g. to present the current question to the living room TV or to a secondary phone so that everyone can see it.
  Join the game with an empty username to do so.
</p>

<p>
  The implementation is a bit buggy.
  Make sure all players are on the same (wifi) network.
  Just reload the game if it gets stuck.
  The game is peer-to-peer (WebRTC) so the host's phone must be always on.
  Don't switch away from the tab or lock the phone or the game might break.
  Also make sure each player picks a different username otherwise it gets weird.
  Open a github issue per contact point below if it's completely broken or if you found a reproducible bug.
</p>

<h2 id=emailgame>Email game <a href=#emailgame>¶</a></h2>

<p>
  The cards can be used in any form you can think of.
  Here's an example for an email game for keeping in touch with a friend with whom you no longer know what to talk about.
  Each week or once a month one of you comes to this site and clicks the "Weekly question" button.
  Then shoots an email like "I think your answer to this question is A because B".
  If you are lucky then the other person will respond "No, it's C because D".
  For extra points they will answer "And I think your answer to the question will be E because F".
  Voila, you are keeping in touch while learning something about the other person.
</p>

<p>
  By default only the softball questions are enabled.
  Enable the private question categories too if you want spicier conversations.
</p>
