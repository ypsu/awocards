<h1>tlewra: The LEast WRong Answer game</h1>

<p>
This site provides bunch of question cards and 2-4 wrong answers for each question.
It's a make your own rules adult game.
The general rule is that the players have to honestly answer the questions.
If none of the answers feels right then they have to choose the <em>least wrong answer</em>.
The other players try to guess what the answer will be.
As a punishment for getting the guess wrong, they have to explain why they thought the answerer will choose their guess.
It's a way to learn about each other for people who struggle with open ended questions.
</p>

<p>
For example suppose the question is "Who is your favorite superhero?" and the answers are Superman, Batman, Ironman, Spiderman.
If your favorite superhero is Deadpool then you might choose Spiderman as your favorite superhero because he's also a fun hero.
You can always explain your real answer after the guessing round ends.
</p>

<p>
There are 4 question categories:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><input type=checkbox id=hqPersonal checked> <label for=hqPersonal>personal: easy, family friendly questions; can be used as a gentle intro into the game.</label>
  <li><input type=checkbox id=hqDivisive> <label for=hqDivisive>divisive: political questions; ideal for turning friends into enemies.</label>
  <li><input type=checkbox id=hqSpicy> <label for=hqSpicy>spicy: nsfw questions; ideal for making people regret coming to your drinking party.</label>
  <li><input type=checkbox id=hqPartner> <label for=hqPartner>partner: spicy questions for folks with partners; ideal for getting couples into fights.</label>
</ul>

<p>
The game supports dares too.
Special rules apply for those, see the <a href=#dares>Dares</a> section below.
There also 2 dare categories. 
</p>

<ul>
  <li><input type=checkbox id=hqDaresLight> <label for=hqDaresLight>dares-light: nsfw but still a relatively gentle intro into dares.</label>
  <li><input type=checkbox id=hqDaresSpicy> <label for=hqDaresSpicy>dares-spicy: sexual in nature; ideal for having a night with nude action that will be forever regretted.</label>
</ul>

<p>
Select the ones you want to play with.
Spoilers: see <a href="questions.js">the source code</a> to see what the questions and dares are.
</p>

<h2>Sample rules for a couples game</h2>

<p>
Two people can this play game just fine:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>In each round one person is the answerer, the other person is the guesser.
  <li>Read the question.
  <li>Decide on the answer or the guess depending on your role.
  <li>Once ready, count to three and on three show the answer number you chose with your hand.
      E.g. open 3 fingers if you answered or guessed answer number 3.
  <li>If the numbers match, all good, go to the next question with the roles reversed.
  <li>If the numbers mismatch, well, you learned something about each other.
      Maybe explain the answer or the guess if it's surprising to the other.
  <li>Stop playing after 20 minutes or so otherwise the game might become too monotone and boring.
  <li>The loser is who guessed wrong more times. The loser does the dishes.
</ul>

<h2>Sample rules for a group game</h2>

<p>
The game is meant for a group of friends who know each other quite well and would like to learn even more about each other.
The ideal player count is 4 to 6 players.
Above that player count the game becomes too cumbersome to manage and people might be more reluctant to open up their dark secrets to a large group.
Split into smaller groups to keep it more personal.
</p>

<p>
Make sure to mentally prepare the players about potentially uncomfortable questions if you enable any of the adult categories.
Only play those categories if everyone agrees to them and there's high trust between everyone.
Allow anyone to stop the game if it gets too heavy.
See the custom questions section on how to fine-tune the questions if needed.
</p>

<p>
Prepare voting chips before the game: cut out small paper pieces and write 1, 2, 3, or 4 onto each.
Players will use these to prepare their answers.
If you have the game Dixit, then you can re-use its <a href=https://boardgamegeek.com/image/456324/dixit>voting chips</a> (or just print and cut out that pic).
Alternatively vote with your hands as in the couples game
(but then people have to remember their choice until the reveal and that can be hard for some).
</p>

<p>
Gameplay:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>In each round one person is the answerer, the other people are the guessers.
      The answerer role goes in a clockwise circle around the table.
  <li>Read the question when the round starts.
  <li>Answerer decides on their answer, the guessers decide what the answerer will answer.
  <li>Each player puts the corresponding voting chip face down in front of them to mark they have decided on their answer.
  <li>Wait until each player picked an answer.
  <li>The reveal phase comes: each player turns their vote chip upside down to reveal their answer.
      Do it at the same time.
      For extra suspense this can be done one player at a time and having the answerer reveal their answer last to eliminate any possibility for cheating.
  <li>If everyone guessed correctly, then no new information was learned, move to next round.
  <li>Otherwise the answerer can pick someone who answered wrong and ask them to explain their guess.
      Why did they think the answerer will choose their guess?
      It's a nice way to learn how other people see the answerer.
      Or people can challenge the answerer's answer if it's not in-line with past behavior.
  <li>The game's host should timebox the discussion phase to 5 minutes so that other players have the chance to embarrass themselves too.
  <li>Stop playing after 30 minutes otherwise the game might become too monotone and boring.
  <li>The loser is who guessed wrong the most often. The loser cleans up after the party.
</ul>

<h2>Separate categories</h2>

<p>
For the sake of example here is an idea for an alternative way to play this.
As the host prepare a printed version of the question cards:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Print each category on a differently colored paper or choose a background color in the advanced settings before printing.
  <li>Laminate the questions.
  <li>Cut them up.
  <li>Throw out the questions that you find too crazy.
  <li>Serve the cards for each category in its own stack.
</ul>

<p>
During the game follow a similar rules as in the group game above with the following changes:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Before each round the answerer throws a dice.
  <li>Dice selects the category they need to pick the card from.
  <li>If they throw 6, they can choose any category.
</ul>

<p>
The advantage of this is that you can fully throw out a category mid-game if people find it too intense.
That might be the case with dares, see below.
</p>

<h2 id=dares>Dares</h2>

<p>
Dares are special questions.
They have the form of "Can someone do X to you?".
E.g. "Can someone pour water on your head?".
The answer options are always:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>no
  <li>yes
</ol>

<p>
Other players have to answer this question: "Do you want to do X to the answerer?"
They can answer:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>no
  <li>I can
  <li>I want to
</ol>

<p>
The rules are the following:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>When all players made their choice, the answerer flips their answer chip.
      If it's "no", the round ends without action and moves to the next round.
      The other players don't have to reveal their fantasies.
  <li>When the answerer's answer is "yes" then the other players reveal their answer chips.
      If everyone picked "no" then the round ends without action and moves to the next round.
  <li>Otherwise the answerer can to pick someone from the "I can" and "I want to" crowd to do the action.
      The difference between "I can" and "I want to" is the level of desirability:
      "I can" means the player not particularly interested in the action but happy to do it to make the answerer happy, "I want to" means the player would like to do the action to the answerer if the answerer allows it.
      It's encouraged but not required for the answerer to to prefer folks who voted with "I want to".
      It's discouraged but acceptable for the person to name their partner if they are part of the game.
      If no-one said "I want to" then it's OK for the answerer to skip picking anyone and simply move on without action.
  <li>Then the action is carried out right away in front of the group.
  <li>Each action should take no longer than 1 minute to ensure others don't get bored and the game keeps moving.
  <li>Rule for the spicy version: what happens here, stays here. The players should erase their memory after the game.
</ul>

<p>
Most dares in the spicy version are very sexual in nature.
Make sure this is very clear to all players before enabling these questions.
Not everyone is into such things, especially in a group setting.
Also make it clear that the players can always say no.
Boundaries and consent must be always honored.
</p>

<p>
It's possible to change categories mid-game.
Start with dares-light.
Add dares-spicy only when everyone is drunk enough to not mind nudity.
</p>

<p>
This section is meant for exploring one's boundaries, to practice certain sections of the <a href=https://bettymartin.org/how-to-play-the-3-minute-game/>wheel of consent</a>.
Can I let other people see me or touch me?
Can I actually admit that I'd like to try something on my non-partner person?
Should I try something, even if I don't like it, just to expand my experiences?
Opening up in this way can be life-changing if the group is open-minded enough and nobody takes life too seriously.
Or it can be used in a couples game just to try new things.
Use the simultaneous hand signals as described in the couples game section to answer the desirability of each action and act it out if neither party rejected the act.
</p>

<p>
Remember that the game is make-your-own-rules.
If the above doesn't make sense then alter into something that everyone could enjoy.
</p>

<h2 id=customdb>Custom questions</h2>

<p>
In the advanced settings you can configure custom questions.
Workflow for creating a fully customized game:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Select the custom DB checkbox in the advanced settings.
  <li>Open the <a href=questions.js>source code</a>.
  <li>Copy paste all the questions into the custom questions box.
  <li>Remove the questions and dares you deem inappropriate for your upcoming game session.
  <li>Add any other interesting questions you can think of.
  <li>Start the game as usual.
</ul>

<p>
Note that changing the number of questions will also permute the order of questions even if the seed remains.
Don't change the questions mid-game if that is an issue.
</p>

<h2>Present mode</h2>

<p>
Other devices can "follow" the main device: they will present the same question as the main device.
This can be used to present the current question onto a big screen or to present the current question on 1-2 additional phones.
This way people don't need to awkwardly turn their head to read the question from a single, badly oriented smartphone.
Steps to follow:
<p>

<ol>
  <li>Start a game as usual.
  <li>In the settings click "start hosting".
  <li>Join the game from the other device with the given code.
  <li>Make sure to keep the "name" empty to make the device into a spectator rather than a player.
</ol>

<h2>Online game</h2>

<p>
This site supports playing over web as well.
Follow these steps to set this up:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Make all players join a webconference, e.g. a jitsi call, so that you can communicate effortlessly.
  <li>Start a game as usual.
  <li>In the settings click "start hosting".
  <li>Tell the join code for the other participants and have them join the game with the "join" button above.
  <li>Ask participants to set a name in the settings (otherwise they will be a spectator).
  <li>Each player should use two devices to play: a laptop for having the video call full screen and a phone for answering the questions.
      But playing on a single device and quickly switching between the video and game window should work too.
</ol>

<p>
Once a game has 3 or more people, the interface changes: for each question someone must volunteer to answer it.
Make your own rule for this: e.g. round robin in alphabetical order.
</p>

<p>
Note that the host's device must remain available for the network game to work (the system is peer to peer based on WebRTC).
But another person can start a new game any time.
If the game seed is the same then the question order should be the same as long as they didn't use custom questions.
The new host should be able to quickly jump to the same question the previous host's game was via the settings.
</p>

<h2 id=seed>Game seed</h2>

<p>
By default the order of questions is randomized.
To ensure this random order is predictable, the randomization depends on a seed value configurable in the advanced settings.
It defaults to a value based on the current calendar day.
This ensures the game is easily continuable without needing to tweak the seed value if the host's smartphone breaks or if the game's tab is accidentally closed.
</p>

<p>
Check out the "preview" option in the advanced settings to see what order the questions will be.
Use the "jump to question" button in the mid-game settings to jump to a specific question (e.g. to continue a previous game).
Use the seed value 0 to disable question randomization.
This can be useful for the custom questions where the question order might be significant.
Note that the addition or removal of custom questions completely changes the question order even if the seed remains the same.
</p>

<p>
You can also change the categories mid-game and restart the game (e.g. to remove or add an awkward category).
The order of the questions will be the same.
If you jump to the question you were before the restart then this will miss some questions from the newly added categories.
But that's fine, there are more than enough questions for a party even if some questions are skipped.
</p>

<h2>Other languages</h2>

<p>
Non-English speakers can join the game in present mode and enable the browser's auto-translation for their native language.
This should work well for custom questions too.
